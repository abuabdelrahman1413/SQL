1. **Database Design**:
    
    - Example: Imagine you're building a library management system. Database design is like planning how you'll organize all the books, borrowers, and transactions in the library.
2. **Logical Model**:
    
    - Example: Think of a logical model as drawing a map of your library's layout. You decide where each section will be – like Fiction, Non-fiction, and Reference – without worrying about the specific books yet.
3. **Physical Model**:
    
    - Example: Now, imagine you're actually building the shelves and arranging the books based on your map. This is like translating your logical plan into the real setup of the library.
4. **Requirements Analysis**:
    
    - Example: Before you start building the library, you sit down with the librarian to understand what they need. They might tell you they need a way to track which books are borrowed and when they're due back.
5. **Data Conversion and Loading**:
    
    - Example: When you're moving books from an old library to a new one, you have to make sure you organize them properly in the new shelves. This is like converting and loading data from an old system to a new database.
6. **Testing**:
    
    - Example: Just like you'd check if all the shelves are sturdy and the books are in the right places after setting up the library, testing a database means making sure everything works as expected – like adding a new book or checking out one without any errors.
7. **Normalization**:
    
    - Example: Let's say you have a table for library members and another for books they've borrowed. Instead of repeating member details for each borrowed book, you can normalize by creating separate tables, making it easier to manage and update.
8. **ER Modeling**:
    
    - Example: ER modeling is like drawing a diagram showing how different parts of your library connect. You might draw lines showing that each borrower can borrow many books, but each book can only be borrowed by one borrower at a time.
